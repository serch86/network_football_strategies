# network_football_strategies

In this thesis, we use complex system models, in particular complex network theory to identify strategies and the key players on soccer games using the Matrix of Passes Distribution (MDP) we recreate the network of the match where the nodes are the players and the weighted link are the number of passes naked between the two players during a match, analyzing the characteristics and metrics of the network to obtain the strategy.

Illustrative examples for the teams of Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Germany during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil are analyzed.


## On this repository you will find two directories.

Data R Soccer has some of the data source in pdf format, where we can get the Matrix Distribution Passes, also you will find the gexf files to create some of the networks with Gephi software.

On Soccer Code you find all the scripts of every match analyzed in the project, must of them has a similar code but different name nodes or MDP.
